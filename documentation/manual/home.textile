h1. ==Carbonate==

Module for creating and running database migrations for Play application. To use the module add the module to your **application.conf** file

bc. module.carbonate=${play.path}/modules/carbonate-{version}

Next configure the database and add the carbonate path in to the **application.conf** file, _here we are using id local-mysql_

bc. %local-mysql.db=
%local-mysql.db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/play-test
%local-mysql.db.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
%local-mysql.db.user=root
%local-mysql.db.pass=
%local-mysql.jpa.ddl=none
%local-mysql.carbonate.path=conf/migrations

Now you can create a new migration by

bc. play carbonate:new --%local-mysql

The tool will ask for a short description for the migration which will be added to the migration file name, and then it will create the migration file to the path defined by the **carbonate.path** property. It will compare the models with the database and generate a schema update SQL based on that.

**You should always check the migration generated by the tool before accepting it to production use!**

The new migration will be applied to the database the next time you run your play application

bc. play run --%local-mysql

Please note that if the configuration is missing the **carbonate.path** property the migrations will just be ignored, which is useful if you want to use the mem database in play.
